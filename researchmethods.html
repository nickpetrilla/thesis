The main filmer or photographer will find and choose their preferred angle, or the position from which they will the shoot the trick, and then the secondary filmer or photographer will find an angle that differs from the first angle without obstructing the primary shot. <br><br>For example, one filmer will shoot the trick with close up a wide-angle fisheye lens while the second filmer shoots it long lens, which could mean just using a zoom lens or no lens at all, depending on the build of the camera. <br><br>Essentially, I was just the second angle throughout the duration of my observations. And this was how I was able to gain legitimate access into this culture. Over the past nine months, I was able to conduct this ethnography by participating as just another filmer or photographer on the session. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">ethnography means</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">a recording of people. But when you really unwrap this practice, an ethnography can become a rich and detailed qualitative approach to social research, not without “fuzzy semantic boundaries. (Hammersly, 2007)” Anthropologist have used ethnography since the 19th century, embedding themselves into a culture “in order to document and interpret [its] distinctive way of life, and the beliefs and the values integral to it. (Hammersley 2007)” Ethnographers study people in real-life settings and collect data using informal and unstructured methods, such as observations and conversations. From there, the researcher can analyze and interpret data, making inferences about about “the meanings, functions, and consequences of human actions and institutional practices” that can be implied to the bigger population or to an even a larger social context (Hammersley 2007). Ethnographies are generally open-ended, informal, and do not follow a strict set of operational standards that one might find in more quantitative research methods (cite). It is this flexibility that has lent itself well to other emerging and ever-changing fields outside of anthropology, such as user experience research, product development, and educational research (cite). It is this flexibility that lent itself to the goals of my research as well. Skateboarding and skate media production is unstructured and informal, with very little in the way of statistics or numerical data to support what is happening (cite). The best way to try and examine what is occurring among this culture is through authentic observations, rich conversations, stories, and visual data. 
            <br><br>    
            From the inception of this project, I knew that it would somehow classify as a digital ethnography. But just as the definition of ethnography is broad, the digital classification is not any clearer. Ethnographers that use digital means, such as video to document communities can consider their research digital ethnographies, but so can those who study communities that exist online, in a digital space (cite). Fortunately, I knew I was infact going to need to employ digital technologies to gather the data I needed, such digital photos and videos, as well as observe young people utilizing digital media and technology in both the physical world and the virtual. I also knew I was going to employ digital technologies to represent my findings, where, instead of merely providing my audience with a paper, I would utilize the affordances of web technologies to provide the richest description and experience possible (cite). 
            <br><br>
            With all bases covered, I can feel comfortable classifying my research as digital. However, the classification of auto was a bit more daunting. An autoethnography is exactly what it sounds like, where the researcher examines parts of their own personal experience as it relates to a greater cultural context. Not surprisingly, this method is “seen by some as threatening to social scientific desires for objectivity and researcher neutrality. (Manning and Adams, pg 192,  2015)” Although I understand the concerns, my past involvement and current proximity to the culture basically made it impossible for me to remove my own experiences from the research. My research cannot honestly avoid being an autoethnography.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The participants of this ethnography
                <span class="text-muted">are all skateboarders,</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">specifically those who create skateboarding videos that interact with digital spaces, such as websites, forums, and social media platforms. All were observed in New York City, the greater Los Angeles area, or online and in digital spaces. The majority were male, with the exception of a couple females, and ages spanned a couple decades, ranging from 20 to early 40s. 
            <br><br>
            I am choosing to provide a broad approximation of age because, although I am aware of specific learner characteristics, I wanted to call to attention the intergenerational support that occurs within this culture. The majority of my participants were in their early twenties, and could be classified as youths, young people, or even digital natives (Dingli, Pg 14, 2015). I chose to softly focus on this age because it is an extremely exciting time, not only because of the current technical advances and educational reimagining taking place, but for the cognitive growth occurring as well. New research is showing ages 18 to 25 as “a time of dramatic change[s] in basic thinking structures, as well as in the brain. (MIT 2008)” MIT’s Young Adult Development Project describes this age as “a time of stunning accomplishments and chilling risks,” where young adults develop “more complex thinking, an appreciation for diversity”, and decision making skills that help them prepare and navigate “the future, including choices about health, relationships, education, and careers.” Although skateboarding is a youth culture, with many serious participants belonging to the age range described above, age requirements are non existent. It is not uncommon to see a teenager and an adult in his thirties on the same session. With that being said, it would be a disservice to exclude the older experts who are clearly playing a key role advancing the knowledge of or empowering the younger participants, a la Vygotsky and the Zone of Proximal Development. The gender breakdown of the participants was about 80/20 male to female ratio. This accurately represents the culture, which has historically been seen as a masculine one (CITE Skateperception paper). Skateboarding’s high impact and rebellious nature have long been cited for the low percentage of female participants, a belief I see is changing (Chivers 2007). Although the inclusion of female participants was admittedly deliberate, their perspective and influence was essential.
            <br><br>    
            My participants and their work were all observed in New York City, Los Angeles and neighboring Orange County, and within some form of a digital space, such as a website, forum, or social media platform. The physical locations were chosen primarily out of personal accessibility, but coincidentally and fortunately represented two major, if not the two most major populations of youth skateboard media producers (Try to CITE). New York City, where I am currently studying, is the crown jewel of the East Coast skate scene. Skateboarding media created in New York City has long been revered as more raw, authentic, and stylish then to what's going on the other side of the county. Weather beaten streets and iconic architecture make skateboard footage and photographs shot in New York City a thing of beauty (CITE Skate the world). Despite the weather and the antiquated obstacles, the abundance of young people making skateboard videos based out of New York City is second to maybe only one. That maybe only one is of course the greater LA area (Snyder, 2011). This is where I grew up, or more specifically in suburban Irvine about 40 miles of south of Downtown Los Angeles. Being both the birthplace of skateboarding and home to Hollywood, it should not be a surprise to anyone that skate filmers and photographers are abundant in this Southern California metropolis. My fortunate ties to these skateboarding meccas made the choice of physical locations a no brainer. The time we live in made the third location an obvious choice as well. As my research will show, online and digital spaces are a huge part for skate media makers to share, promote, and elevate their work. The media shared and the communities formed online play a huge part in the progression of this culture. Since the fall of 2015, I have been studying these three skateboard media environments almost exclusively.
            <br><br>
            I began this project in September of 2015 , although my involvement within this culture dates back a couple decades. Earlier in the Fall, I acquired some new camera gear and began going out on more skate sessions than I had in the last few years, with the loose intention of documenting the skateboard ‘filming’ process. The Fall months were spent in New York City, and when the winter came, I conveniently shifted locations to the Los Angeles-Orange County area where I spent half of December and all of January, 2016. On these outings, I would assume the role of backup filmer. I brought with me the normal items skateboard filmers bring; backpack, cameras, batteries, microphones, skateboard, tripod, etceteria. This allowed me to blend in perfectly. When skaters began trying tricks and the filmer began shooting, I would grab and set up one of my cameras, and ask if I could shoot a second angle which was always welcomed. I would then switch between shooting video and shooting photos. 
            <br><br>
            The cameras I used served two very important purposes in my study. First, by acquiring the some cameras that are considered industry standards, I was able to elevate my cultural capital and gain legitimate access to what was occurring on these sessions (CITE CORE article). I was not viewed as a researcher or as an outsider, but as a filmer. After gaining acceptance I was basically free to document whatever occurred throughout the day. The second purpose was of course for capturing visual content for my research. Photographs have both long been viewed as essential tools by many ethnographers, and are essential to those embarking on visual ethnographies (Kharel, 2015). Photos and moving images, such as film in past and now video, have been utilized for over a hundred years by researchers trying to gather a thick and true visual representation of what is occurring within the culture they are studying. While on these sessions, in addition to shooting videos and photos, I would engaged in numerous informal conversations with the filmers. Conversations ranged from Instagram  arguements to camera repair to general insecurities about the future. After each day, I would log my footage and photos, and spend a half hour writing about the particular session and the conversations that occurred. After establishing a real rapport with a few of the filmers, I asked them if we could set up a more formal, yet still quite informal, interview. 
            <br><br>
            These interviews ranged in length and method, but all asked the same questions. I asked each participant how they would prefer to answer these questions, whether in person, via email, or over the phone. I asked each interviewee about 20 questions that pertained to how they acquired the knowledge they gained while creating skateboard media, and about the application of this knowledge in other domains. The interviews that were done in real-time, either over the phone or in-person were recorded using an audio recorder, while email interviews just needed to have the text extracted. I asked questions that encouraged my participants to share personal narratives, in hopes of not only revealing their own knowledge, but their own understanding of how their identity, history, and culture influenced the way the learned and vice versa(Scarino 2012). I would also employ a narrative approach when analyzing the responses and observational material. This serves to provide an organized framework that is easily understood when dissecting observations and stories (Richmond 2002).
            <br><br>
            The last component of my digital ethnography is the platform that I am using to present my research, which is the website that you are on right now. A website, versus the traditional physical paper, allows readers to engage with the content in ways more conducive to learning. The content I am presenting is now multimodal and nonlinear.  Affordances of the web allowed me to create a multimodal learning environment that enhances learning by presenting information both verbally and nonverbally, such as through text, images, and video (Moreno and Mayer, 2007). By providing links and multiple points of access and navigation, readers can create their own paths through the content which allows for cognitive flexibility (Spiro, 1990). And with that all being said, a media rich website is the only way I could truly touch on the unique way technology and media influences learning within this culture.</p>
