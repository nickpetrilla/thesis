            <span class="analysisHeader">Contexts
                for Learning</span>
            <p class="lead">The contexts for learning, or “spheres of learning” that need to be present in order for Connected Learning to be successful, are the basic building blocks for this theory (Ito et al, 2013). These three contexts lay the foundation for the framework and are as follows; peer-supported, interest-powered, and academically oriented.<br><br>
             <span class="analysisSubheader"><b>Peer-supported</b></span>
            <br>
            <i>“In their everyday exchanges with peers and friends, young people are contributing, sharing and giving feedback in inclusive social experiences that are fluid and highly engaging.” -Ito et al, Pg.62, 2013</i>
            <br><br>
            Of course a context, and the concept, of learning that is peer-supported is not one that is unique to this framework. Dewey, Vygotsky, and Wenger, just to name a few, have all discussed at length the importances and nuances of peers within learning. However, Connected Learning framework does not just rely upon peer-support or social structure when reimaging a learning environment. Peer-support is more or less the first gatekeeper, asking the guiding reflection questions, “Are young people given opportunities to contribute expertise, ideas, and questions? Share work? Give feedback to their peers? Socialize and hang out? Mess around/play in a social context?” (Ito et al, pg 62) From this point I will call back to my ethnographic research to find examples of how youth skate media makers would fare when compared to the questions above.<br><br>
            <b>Are young people given the opportunity to socialize and hang out? Mess around/play in a social context?</b><br>
            In all the notes, videos, and photos I presented in the previous section, the participants are close friends with each other, and are, for the most part, engaging in this act of “filming skateboarding” because they enjoy doing it together. There are not rigid chains of command, regiments, or schedules that anyone is following. Although some participants may be getting paid as a result of the skateboarding that is being recorded, this is by and large their form of hanging out, playing, or messing around.<br><br> Matt Bublitz, staff videographer at Thrasher Magazine had this to share when asked about his initial motivation create media, <i>“Producing media, which in skateboarding is basically just going out skating with friends to different locations and collecting footage until you have enough to put together a 2-5 minute part of a particular person, edited to a song, is pretty much the backbone of the core skateboard industry. Once you get even moderately interested in skateboarding you quickly understand this and want to do it yourself...Of course, skateboarding is really fun, which is the real root of all this; that’s what hooks you from the beginning.”</i><br><br> Grant Levy, who initially seemed to hold a somewhat different sentiment, venting about how many skateboarders can be unintelligent or weird, would eventually come full circle and express that the social aspect of skateboard media production is actually one of the most beneficial when considering transferable skills. <i>“...I feel like I am good at dealing with all sorts of people from skateboarding… if you’re a filmer...you have to kick it with a bunch of different people…”</i><br><br>
            <b>Are young people given opportunities to share and give feedback to their peers?</b><br>
            To address this question, all one has to do is look at the online presence of each person I observed to really get a feel for how deep and powerful the sharing process is within skateboard media production. Each person has produced and shared countless videos either on YouTube, Vimeo, or Instagram that have been viewed well over a thousand times, if not more. And it is not uncommon for these videos to take a life of their own after being initially published, shared again by major and some not-so-major skate media outlets and message boards. It is here that the participants can get feedback on a much larger scale, by way of comments. For more personal feedback, a few of the participants mentioned running rough-edits by specific people. In an in-person meeting with Grant Levy, he invited me over to his house and asked for feedback on some rough edits he was working on. In an interview with <a href="http://skateboarding.transworld.net/photos/reel-talk-johnny-wilson/#JBQG9PZRuosqgVyK.99" target="_blank">Transworld Magazine</a>, Johnny Wilson mentions that he makes edits all the time and just sends them to friends. <i>“I’ve made a bunch that no one’s ever seen. [My friends] are always like, ‘Put it out.’ I always mess around with different songs and put them on Vimeo on private and send it to everyone and they’ll tell me what they think.”</i><br><br>
            <b>Are young people given opportunities to contribute expertise, ideas, and questions?</b><br>
            The answer to this questions is clear as well. Both Bublitz and Levy mentioned having personal resources that they could go to when they had questions, as well as noting that specific online forums, namely Skateperception.com also offered a convenient avenue for asking questions when starting out. Kim Woozy also said that, because she had so many caring mentors of her own starting out, she is always willing and enthusiastic to offer expertise to those seeking it.<br><br>
            <span class="analysisSubheader"><b>Interest-powered</b></span><br>
            <i>“When a subject is personally interesting and relevant, learners achieve much higher-order learning outcomes.” -Ito et al Pg.62</i><br><br>
            The next gatekeeper, or context that needs to present, is one that utilizes what it is that genuinely interests a particular learner. This context has much to do with how we motivate ourselves to learn, and how positive emotions greatly strengthen our motivation (Plass et al, 2012). As Matt Bublitz mentioned earlier, skateboarding is really fun. But then again it is also really hard at first. Skateboarders have to be intrinsically motivated to dedicate all the time and physical energy needed to master a certain trick. In a 2010 ethnographic study about skateboarding and motivation, researchers stated that skateboarding was an exemplarily activity to study, due to its lack of extrinsic motivators, such as authority by way of coaches or instructors, and the abundance of satisfying moments facilitated by overcoming and landing challenging tricks (Seifert and Hedderson, 2010). I think it is safe to say that anyone who engages in skateboarding day in and day out like the young people I have documented are deeply interested in it. And it is with this interest that they spend the time needed to learn supplementary 21st century skills, such as media production. To further this claim, I will go through the the guiding reflections that the Connect Learning framework puts forth and again offer inferences from my research. The reflections and answers are below.<br><br>
            <b>Is the experience centered on participant interest (adult and teen)?</b><br>
            It would be hard to find any adults or teens willing to hangout in a sewer pipe for longer than a few minutes, let alone a few hours, if they were not completely enamored with the experience.</p>
            <div class="featurette wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay=".1s" style="text-align:center !important;">
            <img src="img/edited/skip_chris_fullpipe.jpg" style="width:100%;">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">
            The same could be said about rolling through traffic on Flushing Avenue in Brooklyn. The experience of learning video production and creating media in these circumstance are completely centered within the passion these young people have for skateboarding. <br><br>
            <b>Can young people form groups to explore a facet of this interest?</b><br>
            It has become apparent, from my experience, that the groups that skateboarders belong tend form and reform organically. Location, age, skill, and personality tend to dictate what group, or “crew”, a skateboarder will belong to. Because of this, skaters and media makers tend to progress, explore, and progress their interests together. Participants who are younger and just starting out can hone their own skills without pressure from the more advanced groups because what these novices are producing is not meant for anyone outside of their crew. Also because the level of skateboarding is not to a point where the media coverage needs to be advanced, novices can experiment with and explore new techniques and mediums. These groups are not rigid, and one can easily progress to a more advanced group as they attain more skills and develop a stronger bond to the culture. This progression of interest can be seen with my friend Grant Levy. He was the filmer for group of younger skaters who just messed around as kids. As he said in an interview, <i>“I learn something new with each video I put out."</i> As both he and his friends progressed, they put out better videos, and gained access to the more advanced groups. Now that he has been an active participant in this culture for around a decade, he is filming with some of the top professionals.<br><br>
            <b>Are there ways for young people to “lurk” as they discover new interests?</b><br>
            Because skateboarding happens in very public places, both physically and virtually, there are numerous ways for young people to “lurk”, or observe others engage in what it is they would like to learn. Online, all one has to do is navigate what is out there to discover what is out there. When I asked Grant Levy if he ever asked questions on the message board, Skateperception.com, he responded <i>“No, I just lurked.”</i> What he meant was that searched for what he wanted and just read the content without actively participating. In the physical space, lurking might not be as easy or openly accepted, but there is a time and a place when it can be accomplished. At skateparks, novices can easily hangout and watch what the more advanced participants are doing. In addition, it is not uncommon to make your way onto a session with more advanced participants. When I was asked to film for the Thrasher Magazine shoot on January 26th, I basically lurked on the two staff media producers. I just hung out in the back and took mental notes about how they were conducting the shoot. <br><br>
            <b>Are there supports for young people to develop expertise around their interest?</b><br>
            The answer to this question is not as obvious as the some of the others. Because skateboarding is so informal, supports are not as explicit as one might see in other domains, such as organized sports. However, because this culture is not obsessed with rigid age requirements and is so intergenerationally connected, young people have an abundance of older experts to engage with. Matt Bublitz mentioned that <i>“...lately with the advent of Instagram, I’ll get lots of questions either directly on my posts or via direct messages.”</i><br><br>
            <b>Is interest being publicized and celebrated?</b><br>
            If skateboarders are good two things, it is publicizing and celebrating. When a finished product gets released, either a full length skate video with a physical premiere or just a montage for the internet, the community at large becomes aware and ready to celebrate. In the days leading up to the premiere of Johnny Wilson’s video Sure last summer, the instance that sparked this very research, a fury of instagram posts were made from all the stakeholders, making sure everyone in the New York City skate scene and beyond knew there was going to be a celebration.<br><br>
            <b>Are pathways for mastery in an area of interest made visible for others to see, either within the platform or within connected experiences?</b><br>
            I believe skateboard media is a very unique interest in that is has very open lines between amateur and professional. As Matt mentioned above, novices open ask him, an expert, questions quite easily via social media. Grant, an amateur who is actively trying to obtain a professional career, can get his work published on professional outlets amongst professional content. In the Transworl interview with Johnny Wilson, when asked <i>“What advice would you give to filmers trying to get their work seen and work for companies right now?”</i> He responded by saying, <i>“For me, I was just trying to film as much as I can and put out a bunch of stuff...Skate as much as you can. Do whatever you want, film shit however you want, put out whatever you want, and eventually I think it will work.”</i> Johnny's suggested pathways for mastery, while not formal or easy, are pretty basic. Put in work, take risks, and build a network and eventually you will obtain mastery, and possibly even an income.<br><br>
            <span class="analysisSubheader"><b>Academically oriented</b></span><br>
            <i>“Learners flourish and realize their potential when they can connect their interests and social engagement to academic studies, civic engagement, and career opportunity.”-Ito et al Pg.62</i><br><br>
            The third and last learning context that should be present is one that is academically oriented. Basically this is that extremely important component of the experience that can be connected to a more formal educational setting. With that being said, it is this academic orientation that has been the most difficult to nail down when examining this culture and experience. <i>“...I feel like filming skateboarding, if anything, has kept me from excelling in other situations. Like I’ve put so much fucking time and money and effort into something that, really, no one gives a shit about. And is untranslatable [to] other fields of film or [other] occupations in general.”</i> This frustrated quote from Grant, who is in his final year as a film student at a California State University, in a way exemplifies why trying to find the academic connection has not been the easiest. But Grant isn’t the only one who mentioned this missing link between education and skateboard media. Matt Bublitz said that, <i>“There isn’t a school program for skateboard media, so you pretty much have to teach yourself. Sure, there are resources--more than ever, nowadays--but still, there isn’t a well paved path to success like with other lines of work. You have to forge your own path, taking shots in the dark, so to speak, to figure things out.”</i><br><br>
            Instead of trying to find out how youth skateboard media is academically oriented or how we can change this culture to make it more conducive to connected learning, I will take this incongruency as a hint that maybe there is something else we as educators could to harness the power of this already rich experience. The questions pertaining to if and how can formal education support this culture to facilitate an academically oriented context will be contemplated in the upcoming discussion section.

        <div class="featurette" id="contact">
            <span class="analysisHeader">Core Properties</span>
            <p class="lead">Now that I have the contexts covered, basically where the learning occurs, the core properties of Connected Learning will be the next characteristics I search for within youth skateboard media. These properties are what tie together the contexts to make for such a rich learning environment. The core properties include production-centered, shared-purpose, and openly networked.<br><br>
            <span class="analysisSubheader"><b>Production Centered</b></span><br>
            <i>“Digital tools provide opportunities for producing and creating a wide variety of media, knowledge, and cultural content in experimental and active ways.” -Ito et al, pg 72, 2013 </i><br><br>
            The affordances of the 21st century media and technology lend itself extremely well to cultivating a learning environment rich with “production-centered” properties. The omnipresence of smartphones means that everyone with access to these devices can capture, create, distribute, and view personal media. In line with constructionism, a production-centered environment allows for learners to access and represent knowledge in a way that is most conducive to their individual needs (Kafai & Resnick, 1996). It is this flexibility that allows for participants to experiment, and fail often. Due to the repetitive nature, constant presence of failure, and the culture of sharing, the act of skateboarding and producing skateboard media lends itself well as a production-centered environment. Below I will use the reflecting questions to support this claim. <br><br>
            <b>Do young people have access to digital production tools?</b><br>
            In the study I conducted, almost everyone present had access to a digital production tool, ranging from a 20 year-old “HandyCam” to smartphones to DSLRs to professional-grade High Definition video cameras. 100% of the media producers that I studied, of course, had access. But just to back this up with broader statistics, the Pew Research Center states that 73% of teens and 86% of 18-29 year olds have access to a smartphone in the U.S. Of course, this unfortunately isn’t everyone. Unequal access to dependable technology is becoming one of major factors in the stratification of educational quality (Robinson et al, 2015). Because this technology is usually personally obtained by the participant, not borrowed from a school or public institution, this environment may not alway accessible to all participants regardless of socioeconomic status. This issue will be discussed further in the upcoming discussion section.<br><br>
            <b>Are there structures to support remix of other’s work and the curation of community work? </b><br>
            Remixing in skateboarding media is definitely supported. Because media is so freely shared on platforms like YouTube or Vimeo, it has become quite easy to download the videos to be re-edited. A recent trend has emerged where the media producer will release “raw” footage, skate video clips without music or elaborate post production, that allows for other users to download the clips for remixing. Larger media outlets have even celebrated these remixes by having contests where users submit their best remixes in hopes to win a prize, most likely skateboarding products. Below is just one example of a remix that features footage my friends and I shot when we were younger, that has now been remixed by an unknown YouTuber.</p>

            <p class="lead">
            <b>Is work visible/discoverable to others within the environment? Outside of the core site? Are artifacts easily exportable?</b><br>
            As I mentioned in previous reflections, the online community of skate media makers is very well connected. <i>“I think I was a part of the first generation of kids posting a bunch of bullshit on YouTube. I got into it when YouTube started blossoming I think. It’s weird because now, it’s like even though not that many people were viewing it, now its like 10 years later and a bunch of people have randomly seen all those videos.”</i> This story shared by Grant is not uncommon. After a video gets published onto YouTube or Vimeo, it is very likely, if it is of quality, that others will share it on their social media pages, website, or blog. From there it may be discussed in an online forum or posted by a major media outlet such a Thrasher Magazine or Thrasher. There are numerous ways for any given person to happen upon someone else’s work. There is also a chance that a physical copy, such as a DVD, may even be created and sold independently or through a physical store, promoting agency among participants. When I questioned Grant Levy about what was the last big learning moment he had from skateboard media production, he answered with, <i>“I learned about getting [videos] into skateshops…”</i><br><br>
            <span class="analysisSubheader"><b>Shared Purpose</b></span><br>
            <i>“Social media and web-based communities provide unprecedented opportunities for cross-generational and cross-cultural learning and connection to unfold and thrive around common goals and interests.” - Ito et al, 2013, pg 12</i><br><br>
            This property is one that is meant to promote real world 21st century skills. In the real world, which in this case is anywhere outside of the classroom, most challenging tasks involve working with other people to meet a goal. We work with a wide variety of people such as peers, co-workers, bosses, friends, spouses, etc. Tasks and responsibilities are delegated to the stakeholders to help achieve the goal in an easier way. In the creation of skate videos, this too is very true. The overarching goal of most youth produced skate video is to display the hard work that a group of friends put forward to successfully land, record, and curate tricks.<br><br>
            <b>Are activities organized around projects with a shared goal?</b><br>
            Matt Bublitz had this to share about sharing a goal during skateboard media production. <i>“Another key skill that applies elsewhere is teamwork. With producing skate media, I’m dealing with so many different players: skaters, team managers, brand managers, record companies, other filmers, etc. Constantly dealing and collaborating with different people teaches me how to navigate the world with a little more grace than I was born with.”</i><br><br>
            <b>Are there opportunities for young people to team and compete, either at individual or group levels? </b><br>
            This is another question that isn’t as black and white as some of the previous, but I still see a connection to how participants utilize teams and competition to enrich this environment. Because everything is shared so openly, it is easy to view the media that other participants are making. When a crew of young skaters put out a great product, this serves to motivate other young skaters that may see it to try and do better. Matt Bublitz put it perfect when he answered a question about sharing work, <i>“If I saw someone else’s work that I thought was good, I wouldn’t like it because I would be jealous it wasn’t me, and if I saw someone else’s work that was bad, I wouldn’t like it because I knew I could do better. Obviously that’s a pretty immature attitude, and I think I’ve grown out of that for the most part.”</i> Although Matt may see this as a childish mindset to have now, it almost certainly served him well when he was younger, striving to share the best product possible.<br><br>
            <b>Does the experience support cross-generational leadership and ownership? Is authority distributed across youth and adult spaces?</b><br>
            The cross-generational aspect of skateboard media production is definitely present. Again, many of the sessions I went on had participants whose ages ranged from late teens to early thirties. Skateboarding is a youth culture, and as an industry, it is driven by the interests and decisions of young people (Buckingham, 2009). In a sense, many professional media makers have to listen to and know what youth think is cool or important. <i>“In our industry, it’s the opposite, it’s like the older you get, the less relevant you are so it’s constantly reinventing itself.”</i> This quote from Kim Woozy expresses how, in skateboarding, young people a lot of times are the authority. They are the ones who are dictating what it is that this culture cares about. This is why a video made by a 21 year old in New York City could be sponsored by Nike.<br><br>
            <span class="analysisSubheader"><b>Openly Networked</b></span><br>
            <i>“Online platforms and digital tools can make learning resources abundant, accessible, and visible across all learner settings.” - Ito et al, 2013, pg 12</i><br><br>
            An openly networked quality is the third and final core property that should be present for a connected learning environment to thrive. This property basically has to do with accessibility and low-barriers of entry. Fortunately, this is something the skateboard culture prides itself on. Ideally all one needs to participate is a skateboard. Below I go through a few of the reflection questions about openly networked environments to see how true this ideal really is.<br><br>
            <b>Are groups loosely networked?</b><br>
            his again ties back to skateboarding’s informal qualities. Because there are no real teams, participants can hangout with whomever they would like. At a skatepark or a street skate spot it is not uncommon to see multiple groups all occupying the same space to eventually merge into one larger group. In the session on <a href="fieldnotes.html#nycVig5" target="_blank">October 25th in Brooklyn</a>, numerous crews converged onto one spot. From there multiple filmers and photographers worked together to share the space efficiently. What resulted was a collaborative video that promoted products from two different skateboarding entities, the Quartersnacks website and the DGK skateboard company.<br><br>
            <b>Are there easy ways for groups/participants to connect and coordinate action or activity?</b><br>
            The answer to this is similar to some of the previous answers about the abundance of content sharing and promoting occurring within skateboarding. New media platforms such a Instagram make it easy for media makers to connect and coordinate action. In a conversation with Kim Woozy, she mentioned that Instagram has been a huge catalyst for the exponential growth of skateboarders that are girls. Now that these participants can easily capture, post, view, connect, and communicate all in one place, girls do not have to see themselves the odd one out. If they feel inclined, participants can easily message one another and build relationships, as was seen on the session at <a href="fieldnotes.html#girlsCherrypark" target="_blank">Cherry Park with Kim</a> and the other skaters. The girls on this session are not all from the same geographic location, however, because skateboarding and skateboard media is openly networked, it was easier for them to connect and collaborate now than it has ever been in the past.<br><br>
            <b>Are there multiple points of entry and outreach? </b><br>
            Skateboarding, for better or for worse, is not always organized. For many participants, myself included, skateboarding was found by happenstance, by being at the right place at the right time. The production of skateboarding media was even more random. There are not many organizations out there reaching out to young people to make skateboarding videos. It is something that young people, for the most part, find on their own. Each participant I talked to was not exactly sure how they initially got into skateboarding or media production, but more or less said it was something they thought looked fun or wanted to try with friends. Due to this lack of organization, points of entry and outreach, along with an academically oriented context and accessibility, will be discussed further in the upcoming section.

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Discussion
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Now that I have gone through the framework, and justified skateboard media production as a viable learning environment with many of the contexts and properties aligning with what Connected Learning calls for, I will go forth and discuss a few of the challenges that I recognized between youth skate media and the framework. Multiple points of entry and outreach, accessibility, and an academically oriented context are all aspects of a connected learning environment that I identified as having some incongruencies with the youth media culture occurring in skateboarding today.<br><br>
                <i>Young people and adult mentors can ideally enter connected learning environments through multiple channels, including those centered on friendship, interests, or schools. The environment should not rely on a single pipeline for participants to learn about and join the group. The opportunities offered by the space can be public and publicized in ways that are attractive and accessible to diverse youth, parents, and educators. - Ito et al, pg. 77, 2013</i><br><br>
            Connected Learning states that environments should be openly-networked, with multiple points of entry and outreach to allow for a diverse range of participants. Now while skateboarding does definitely occur in a public space with multiple points of entry open for anyone who is interested, this is not formalized nor is it publicised. Historically, participants become skateboarders and skateboard media producers organically. Unlike Little League Baseball or an after-school makerspace, skateboarding is generally not something one signs up for. Not one of the participants I interviewed utilized a formal or organized pipeline to access this culture. Personally, it was skateboarding’s early informality and freedom from a structured access that appealed to me. Skateboarding and producing media for skateboarding was something we discovered. I believe that this freedom and authenticity plays a big role in fostering intrinsic motivation and creativity. Because skateboarding and skateboard media is this informal and ever-evolving youth culture, it’s participants are empowered to contribute and find agency in anyway they know how. By giving participants the ability to make this environment whatever it is they want it to be, young people have the flexibility to test the waters and fail wildly. If afterschool programs or formal organizations become the primary avenue for youth to learn skateboarding and media production, which is very possible, will the experience still be as rich and dynamic? As of right now, I have my inclinations, but that is not to say I know the answer. As skateboarding makes its way into the public eye more and more, I am willing to guess community organizations, just like the corporate footwear giant Nike, will take notice of the commitment young people make to this culture. Although it is unclear what the formalization of skateboarding could result in, I believe it is an interesting topic to pay close attention too.<br><br>The next challenge was accessibility. Unfortunately, the informality that I just mentioned above means access to technology falls solely on the individual. Participants are responsible for buying their own gear, which can be extremely expensive for a young person, with cameras, lenses, computers, software, and other associated components costing well into the thousands of dollars. The result is that money becomes a barrier to access. The question this challenge presents is how can offer young people affordable access to technology? The answer to this challenge appears to be a little clearer than the questions presented above. Public institutions, like schools, have also been making an effort to reimagine their place in an ever-changing society. Many libraries have started to reposition themselves as more than just a repository of literature, now offering access to a wide variety of technologies. For example, a program called <a href="http://www.chipublib.org/programs-and-partnerships/youmedia/" target="_blank">YOUmedia</a> at the Chicago Public Library has aligned itself with the research of Ito and the DML Hub, offering a drop-in out of school space for young people to utilize technology and media.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NwPQzDsNVPU"></iframe>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="lead"> It is not too far of a stretch to imagine more institutions following this model, offering young people a place to access high quality technological tools that could be used to produce rich works, including skateboard media.
            <br><br>
            The last challenge I see is orienting youth skateboard media as an academic endeavor. In Connected Learning, this is the context that bridges the gap between what young people enjoy, and school. It is how young learners, “connect their interests and social engagement to academic studies, civic engagement, and career opportunity. (Ito et al, pg 62, 2013)” Of course, skateboarding and skateboard media production can achieve this orientation. But should it have to? And what would be lost? Again as I have mentioned before, skateboarding is devoid of rigidity. There is no curriculum, no grade, no homework, and definitely no one to answer to. It is not hard to consider that maybe it is these qualities that attract so many motivated, creative, yet possibly stifled or uninspired, young people. While barely passing my senior year of high school, my dad would constantly say, <i>“If you paid as much attention to school as you do to your skateboard or your videos, you would have straight A’s.”</i> At the time, I did not have an answer but now I think the question could easily be flipped. If school paid as much attention to skateboarding as I did, I would have had straight A’s. Instead we were told we were wasting our time. Again, to quote my friend Grant Levy, <i>“...I feel like filming skateboarding, if anything, has kept me from excelling in other situations. Like I’ve put so much fucking time and money and effort into something that, really, no one gives a shit about.”</i> Imagine if educators did care? Would Grant still see his passion as a waste? Or Would he be empowered to go further? In my interview with Kim Woozy, she mentioned that skateboarding as a business is unique because it is extremely youth driven. If a company can not cater to young people, the company will fail. As educators, maybe we need to be more these companies, more like Nike. Let’s find the cool things young people do, and promote them. Why do we need to formalize it? Why do we need to slap an academic label on it?<br><br>
            Although I presented the information above as challenges or lofty unanswered questions, I do in fact see them as opportunities. Just because skateboarding and skateboard media production does not smoothly align with all the Connected Learning framework does not mean it should not be seen as a rich informal learning environment. By showcasing the amount of work and skill young people display in skateboard media in this ethnography, and by employing Connected Learning to frame my findings, it should be apparent something special is occurring here. While it might not be totally accessible right now, by providing access to technology, public institutions have the opportunity to change that in the near future. And while it might not be best suited for formal pathways to entry or an academic orientation, as educators we have the opportunity to facilitate growth by merely recognizing and celebrating what is occurring. We have an opportunity to see what some may label as a waste of time, beyond just skateboarding, and reevaluate it as the rich environment that it potentially may be.
