              <p>By the 1970s, skateboarding was moving away from a novelty and into a full-blown youth culture. Young skateboarders would utilize modern architecture to propel themselves up and down embankments and empty swimming pools, mimicking the movements learned in the nearby Pacific Ocean. The images shot by Glen E. Friedman around this time, like the one featured above, would visually promote and progress the culture in fledgling magazines. Years later they would serve as inspiration for award winning books, documentaries, and feature films.

            <p class="lead">VVygotsky, Papert, and Piaget were making influential waves in the world of education and the social sciences, a subculture, one which exemplifies the very theories laid out by the aforementioned theorists, was taking shape in Southern California. This subculture has long been regarded, at least by those paying any attention, as gritty, creative, rebellious, and resourceful; as a culture that notices the potential in the seemingly mundane and embodies a punk rock do-it-yourself ethos. They are an intrinsically motivated group of youthful autodidacts, studying and emulating the movements of experts seen on the now omnipresent screen. <br><br>There is so much more to this culture than the archetypal adolescent placing one foot on a skateboard, one foot on the ground, and setting sail with wild abandon down Wilshire Boulevard or up Broadway.  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/20/skate-city-skateboarders-developers-bans-defensive-architecture"target="_blank">Architecture</a>, <a href="http://www.kennedy-center.org/festivals/finding-a-line/welcome" target="_blank">art</a>, <a href="http://www.kvia.com/video/ponding-area-to-serve-as-skate-park/36924142" target="_blank">engineering and government</a> have all been influenced in some way by this culture.<br><br>While some may see this culture as a nuisance or vandalous, for many young people, skateboarding may be one of few things with which they can connect. For myself and thousands of other adolescents, skateboarding connected us to technology, media, and other creative, empowering endeavors. The ethnographic study I am embarking on aims to provide a rich description of how the skateboarding subculture interacts with media and technology, and how learning and knowledge acquisition within and from this domain might align with the Connected Learning framework.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">My Obsession
                <span class="text-muted">with skateboarding</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">began in the mid-1990’s in Orange County, California. I was about eight years old, and not yet aware that the skateboard I was about to pick up was going to mold my personality, guide my future, and become my motivation to learn, a common sentiment shared by so many lifers. By the time I entered junior high school, I did not just ride a skateboard, skateboarding was completely my identity. As my obsession grew, my grades fell and the classroom, homework, sports, parties, and dances, basically anything that one associates with being a student in suburbia, became obstacles that prevented me from indulging in the culture with which I became so enamored.<br><br> School days were anxiously spent daydreaming about that afternoon’s session, while nights, when the darkness finally rendered the session over, were spent watching skate videos. My bulky collection of VHS tapes, filled with fuzzy footage of professional skaters, was my library, my own version of an asynchronous education.<br><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv_tEkJU0-Q" target="_blank">Timecode</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AlvM7yp9yk" target="_blank">Trilogy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2BSFkTZ6FE" target="_blank">Mouse</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tx2Q9pNxPc" target="_blank">Welcome to Hell</a> where some of the my early favorites. My friends and I would spend hours studying these tapes. By watching the professionals in these videos, we learned how tricks were possible and what tricks were cool. The gritty lo-fi aesthetic, while capturing the energy of the times, skating, and the culture, also offered an access point into this video world. These videos, although produced by companies and featured professional riders, were not polished. They were endearingly shot on consumer level handheld video cameras in a setting and aesthetic that practically begged me to participate, gripped by the shaky hands of young people in nearby LA school yards.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> get our own shaky hands on a camera and a cheap wide angle lens and began emulating what we saw on the screen, rolling alongside each other, taking turns holding the camera. This hobby would grow and lead to better cameras, ones that could easily interface my family’s desktop computer. Soon I would discover video editing, and begin creating and sharing the videos that we produced. In the process, I discovered a vast community of young practitioners not unlike myself. Early online forums, such as <a href="http://forums.skateperception.com/" target="_blank">skateperception.com</a> and the now defunct digitalskate.net, not only provided a platform to share my creations but also a place to hone my craft. Here I asked for feedback, received praise, and searched for solutions. Although not apparent to myself, my obsession with skateboarding was leading to an exploration and acquisition of marketable knowledge and skills.<br><br> By my senior year of high school, while garnering a D+ grade point average, I had developed a photographic eye, was a proficient video editor using industry standard software, could mess around with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and was diving into the world of web development and blogging by building a website to host my footage and opinions.It has been a little over a decade since these transformative years and I am still skateboarding, and still using it as a catalyst to learn new skills. In every educational and professional setting since high school, I have been able to apply the desirable knowledge I gained through my obsession with skateboarding. <br><br>What's more important is that my situation is in no way unique. In almost any major metropolitan area, you will find young skateboarders exploring pockets of the city, learning and utilizing real world technological skills by creating something important to them and the culture with which they connect (Dixon, 2011).<br><br> Now, as a graduate student of education and design, I am choosing to describe this phenomena that is occurring globally among young skateboard media makers, and pay homage to the culture that facilitated my learning by way of a digital ethnography. This ethnography will present how three separate groups of young media makers connect together skateboarding, media, and technology, and examine how these experiences might fit within the connected learning framework. Finally, I will discuss the challenges and possible opportunities of skateboard media as a connected learning environment.

            <p class="lead">However, before diving right into the ethnography, it is important to provide a brief history lesson. The history of skateboarding and skateboard media, as with any subculture struggling with its popularity and desire to be true to its humble roots, has been celebrated, romanticised, and mythologized so many time by those who find it important that I am somewhat embarrassed to participate. Yet here I am, indulging in the self-important ritual. Below is a short timeline highlighting selected works and moments that I believe exemplify my perceived history of skateboarding, its DIY ethos, and its connection to media and technology. <a href="#timeline"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span></a>

                        <p>While not perfectly clear to me, it is my understanding that the birth of skateboarding is said to have spawned from Southern California surf culture. In a DIY fashion that still resonates with the generations of skaters that followed, young surfers would modify toy scooters and roller skates with boards that could be ridden on pavement in the same manner a surfer rides a wave. When the waves were flat, hills and drainage pipes filled in. (Weyland, 2001).</p>

These images and stories would later be celebrated in the award winning documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275309/" target="_blank">“Dogtown and The Z-boys”</a> and the major motion picture <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0355702/" target="_blank">“Lords of Dogtown”</a>.</p>

                        <p>“Three decades ago, Stacy Peralta, Craig Stecyk, and George Powell created a radical new form of endemic propaganda: the skateboard video. They gambled on the newfangled home videocassette recorder, a burgeoning consumer electronic that allowed civilians to watch movies of their choice, whenever they wanted, on their television sets. Released in 1984, The Bones Brigade Video Show wildly exceeded expectations and served as a nuclear propagating tool, encouraging skating’s growth worldwide. Instead of mimicking a stale sports program, it played like an anarchic infomercial selling the wonderful world of skateboarding at a time when its popularity was at a historic low.” (<a href="http://theridechannel.com/features/2014/12/stacy-peralta-bones-brigade-video-show" target="_blank">Mortimer, 2014</a>)

                        <p>The Burnside Skatepark in Portland, Oregon is not necessarily an example of skateboarding’s relationship with media and technology, however I feel it adequately displays this culture’s ingenuity and resourcefulness. The skatepark was illegally constructed under the Burnside bridge in 1991 by the Portland skateboard community. It was funded out of the skaters’ pocket and everything was done by hand. It was eventually approved by the city as a public skatepark, but more importantly it sparked a DIY skate-spot movement with skater-built obstacles popping up in under utilized space across the globe.

                        <h2>Video Days</h2>

                        <p>Video Days came out over a half decade before I started obsessively watching skate videos. I would always read or hear about this video, which featured great music and stylish skaters, yet I could never get my hands on it. The fact that Jason Lee, who had recently retired from skateboarding to pursue an acting career, had a part in it and that Spike Jonze, who was well on his trajectory to creating academy award winning work, shot and edited it only added to its mystique. When I finally saw it I immediately recognized its importance. It captured what it felt like to be out in a city, skating, progressing, and enjoying your youth with your friends. The unpolished aesthetic, LA backdrop, and vignettes of light hearted immaturity served as a lo-fi template for the hundreds of videos that would follow. The name says it all. </p>

                        <p>Sony’s DCR-VX1000 came out in 1996 and quickly became the skateboard industry standard the next decade and a half. It’s durable design, compatibility with desktop video editing software, and affordability all contributed to the success of this camera in the skate video market. However, it was it’s pairing with the Century Optics wide angle fisheye lens, also known as the death lens, that truly made it stand out. To this day, 20 years after it hit the market, the Sony VX1000 equipped with a death lens is still the camera of choice to many skateboard video makers.</p>
