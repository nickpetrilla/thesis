            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Vygotsky, Papert, and Piaget were making influential waves in the world of education and the social sciences, a subculture, one which exemplifies the very theories laid out by the aforementioned theorists, was taking shape in Southern California, emerging from the Pacific Ocean’s coastal customs, traversing paved school yard embankments, and catching flight in a drought-induced mecca of barron backyard pools. This subculture has long been regarded, at least by those paying any attention, as gritty, creative, rebellious, and resourceful; as a culture that notices the potential in the seemingly mundane and embodies the do-it-yourself ethos; as an intrinsically motivated group of youthful autodidacts, independently emulating the movements of the experts seen on the now omnipresent screen. This subculture is as nuanced as any other performing art and is just as punishing as any other high impact sport; often described as poetry in motion and proudly compared to and accompanied by jazz. There is so much more to this culture than the archetypal adolescent placing one foot on the board, one foot on the ground, and setting sail with wild abandon down Wilshire Boulevard.  Architecture, art, education, engineering, and government have all been influenced in some way by this culture’s way of life. While some argue that participants in this culture can thrive in numerous creative endeavors, there is one such pocket where, in my mind, skaters do things in a unique way. The ethnographic study I am embarking on aims to provide a rich description of how the skateboarding subculture interacts with media and technology, and how learning and knowledge acquisition occurs within this domain.<br><br></p>

                <span class="text-muted">with skateboarding</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">began in the mid-1990’s in Orange County, California. I was maybe seven or eight years old, and was not yet aware that the skateboard I was about to pick up was going to mold my personality, guide my future, and become my motivation to learn, a common sentiment shared by so many lifers. By the time I entered junior high school, I did not just ride a skateboard, skateboarding was completely my identity. As my obsession grew, my grades fell. The classroom, homework, sports, parties, and dances, basically anything that is ubiquitous with growing up in suburbia, became distractions, obstacles that prevented me from indulging in the culture with which I became so enamored. School days were anxiously spent daydreaming about that afternoon’s session, while nights, when the darkness finally rendered the session over, were spent watching skate videos. My bulky collection of VHS tapes, filled with fuzzy footage of professional skaters, was my library, my own version of an asynchronous education; of distance learning. Timecode, Trilogy, Mouse, and Welcome to Hell where some of the my early favorites. My friends and I would spend hours studying these tapes. This gritty lo-fi aesthetic, while capturing the energy of the times, skating, and the culture, offered an access point into this world. These videos, although produced by companies and featured professional riders, were not polished. They were endearingly shot on consumer level handheld video cameras, gripped in the shaky hands of young people in nearby LA school yards, a setting and aesthetic that practically begged me to participate.</p>

            <p class="lead"> get our hands on a camera and a cheap wide angle lens and began emulating what we saw on the screen, rolling alongside each other with a video camera hanging from our arm. This hobby eventually grew and lead to better cameras, ones that could easily interface the family desktop computer, which coincidentally had the necessary user-friendly video editing software already loaded. Not before long, I was creating and sharing videos of my friends skating online, and discovering a vast community of young practitioners not unlike myself. Online forums, such as skatepercption.com and the now defunct digitalskate.net, not only provided a platform to share my creations but also a place to hone my craft. Here I asked for feedback, received praise, and searched for solutions. Although not apparent to myself, my obsession with skateboarding was leading to an exploration and acquisition of marketable knowledge. By my senior year of high school, amidst garnering a D+ grade point average, I had developed a photographic eye, was a proficient video editor using industry standard software, could mess around with Photoshop and Illustrator, and was diving into the world of web development by building a website to host our footage. It has been a little over a decade since these transformative years and I am still skateboarding, and still using it as a catalyst to learn new skills. In every educational and professional setting since high school, I have been able to apply the desirable knowledge I gained through my obsession with skateboarding. What's more important is that my situation is in no way unique. In almost any major metropolitan area, you will find young skateboarders in the streets learning and utilizing real world technological skills by creating something important to them and the culture of which they identify. Now, as a graduate student of education and design, I am choosing to describe this phenomena that is occurring globally among young skateboard media makers, and pay homage to the culture that facilitated my learning by way of a digital ethnography. This ethnography intends to provide a rich description into the constructivist culture that is youth skate media.

                        <p>While not perfectly clear to me, it is my understanding that the birth of skateboarding is said to have spawned from Southern California surf culture. In a DIY fashion that still resonates with the generations of skaters that followed, young surfers would modify toy scooters and roller skates with boards that could be ridden on pavement in the same manner a surfer rides a wave. When the waves were flat, hills and drainage pipes filled in a concrete stand in. (Weyland, 2001)</p>

                        <p>The Z-boys, or the Zephyr Competition Team, were the group of Southern California skateboarders credited as the early pioneers of modern skate culture. Their innovative approach and attitude propelled skateboarding from novelty to lifestyle. I personally feel this was due in large part to their media coverage and representation provided by talented photographers, filmmakers, and writers, such as Craig Stecyk and Glenn E. Friedman.</p>

What started 35 years ago as a small scale print publication with a punk rock ethos is now a rich multimedia cultural outlet affectionately referred to as “The Bible”. With groundbreaking skateboarding videos and photos being broadcasted daily on their website, Thrasher Magazine has become one of the cultural taste makers, and exemplifies how media progresses this culture.</p>

                        <p>This video came out a few years before I was born and, to be perfectly honest, I have not watched it in it’s entirety. However, I would be remissed if I did not include something about it in this historical account. <br><br> “Three decades ago, Stacy Peralta, Craig Stecyk, and George Powell created a radical new form of endemic propaganda: the skateboard video. They gambled on the newfangled home videocassette recorder, a burgeoning consumer electronic that allowed civilians to watch movies of their choice, whenever they wanted, on their television sets. Released in 1984, The Bones Brigade Video Show wildly exceeded expectations and served as a nuclear propagating tool, encouraging skating’s growth worldwide. Instead of mimicking a stale sports program, it played like an anarchic infomercial selling the wonderful world of skateboarding at a time when its popularity was at a historic low.” (Mortimer, 2014)

                        <p>The Burnside Skatepark in Portland, Oregon is not necessarily an example of skateboarding’s relationship with media and technology, however I feel it adequately displays this culture’s ingenuity and resourcefulness. The skatepark was illegally constructed under the Burnside bridge in 1990 by the skateboard community. It was funded out of the skaters pocket and everything was done by hand. It was eventually approved by the city as a public skatepark, but more importantly it sparked DIY skate spot movement, with skater-built obstacles popping up in under utilized space across the globe.</p>

                        <p>Video Days came out over a half decade before I started obsessively watching skate videos. I would always read or hear about this video, which featured the best music and the most stylish skaters, yet could never get my hands on it. The fact that Jason Lee, who had recently retired from skateboarding to pursue an acting career, had a part in it and that Spike Jonze, who was currently directing popular music videos and commercials, and who was well on his trajectory to academy award winning accolades, filmed and edited it only added to its mystique. When I finally saw it, a good 15 years after it was released, I immediately recognized its importance. It captured what it felt like to be out in a city, skating, progressing, and enjoying your youth with your friends. The unpolished aesthetic, LA backdrop, and vignettes of light hearted immaturity served as a lo-fi template for the hundreds of videos that would follow. </p>

                        <p>Around the beginning of 1998, my brother got a Panasonic VHS-C camcorder and a cheap wide-angle lens. As my brother’s interests changed, the camera was mine for the taking, and by the year 2000, at age 13, I was shooting videos of skateboarding any chance I could get. </p>
