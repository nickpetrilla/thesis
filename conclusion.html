            <p class="lead">with consuming and creating media for skateboarding, and understanding how it engaged and connected me to numerous learning opportunities, I knew I wanted to showcase this environment to others. By utilizing digital ethnographic methods to document young skateboard media makers in New York City and Los Angeles engaging in similar situations, I was able to display the unique and dynamic ways this culture utilizes digital media and technology to progress themselves. The Connected Learning Framework, which promotes peer-supported, interest driven, and academically oriented contexts blended together with production-centered, shared, and openly networked properties, offered a clear lens in which to view my findings. Although skateboard media production aligned quite well with the framework, there we some clear incongruencies, such as access and formality, that could serve as opportunities for educators to reimagine their own perceptions of what a learning environment looks like.</p>

            <p id="mattInterview" class="lead"><i><b>Interview with Matt Bublitz</b><br>Email Correspondance from March 2016</i><br><br>

                <b>Where are you currently based/located?</b><br>
                I currently live in Huntington Beach, and am more generally “based” in all of Southern California, traveling around Orange County and Los Angeles for my work.<br><br>
                <b>What is your current occupation?</b><br>
                Staff Videographer for Thrasher Magazine. I also do freelance video/editing/photo work on a nonregular basis for other various companies.<br><br>
                <b>Can you describe your educational experience?</b><br>
                I went to public schools in Huntington Beach, then went to Orange Coast College after high school, then transferred after two years to UC Berkeley as an Economics major, where I earned my BA.<br><br>
                <b>How long have you been skateboarding?</b><br>
                I don’t remember exactly, but I know I at least have had a skateboard since I was around 5 years old because my first school picture (pre-school) had me with a scrape on my nose from skateboarding the day before haha. I became seriously interested in skateboarding (following the magazines, videos, current events, etc.) starting in like seventh grade (so when I was 12, I guess).<br><br>
                <b>How long have you been making skateboarding media? At what age did you start?</b><br>
                I started making skateboard media, which started as strictly documenting tricks (badly), as soon as I become seriously interested in skateboarding, so since I was 12 years old. I eventually collected made my first full-length video with my friends when I was in 8th grade, when I was 14 years old.<br><br> 
                <b>Describe your initial motivation to begin producing media?</b><br>
                Producing media, which in skateboarding is basically just going out skating with friends to different locations and collecting footage until you have enough to put together a 2-5 minute part of a particular person, edited to a song, is pretty much the backbone of the core skateboard industry. Once you get even moderately interested in skateboarding you quickly understand this and want to do it yourself. It’s an integral part of the culture of skateboarding to document tricks to benchmark the progress of the “sport” and to showcase individual style. To answer your question more directly, I was basically just assimilating into a culture I was really interested in, trying to be like the guys I looked up to, who filmed and made cool skate videos. Of course, skateboarding is really fun, which is the real root of all this; that’s what hooks you from the beginning.<br><br> 
                <b>How did you initially know what to do?</b><br>
                I mean, I didn’t necessarily know how to do anything at first. I just knew I had to point and shoot to capture the trick. There weren’t any considerations of artistic vision, that’s for sure. Or even technical basics like shutter speed and aperture I didn’t know anything about. Luckily, I was able to use my family’s hi-8 camera, which had an auto mode, to start filming fairly easily. Basically, though, it was a lot of imitation--seeing things I liked in skate videos that I would try to recreate. Skate videos we’re my textbooks. Actually more like my bibles, really. Because not only do skate videos have basic information like how to frame a skate scene in-camera or how to zoom, etc., they have a magic to them that inspires you to want to go skate and make your own videos, too. They’re both practical and romantic, in that way.<br><br> 
                <b>When you were first starting out, how did you find help?</b><br>
                As far as filming/editing go, the majority of my “help” early on was basically just me comparing my work to the work that the pros were doing. For example, when Emerica’s video “This is Skateboarding” came out, it provided me with an ideal of a skate film. Like Plato’s Theory of Forms, I tried to represent that divine form, but ended up with mere flawed attempts. So at least I had a rubric in that way--something to shoot for. It was pre-YouTube, obviously, which made the learning curve a lot slower, but regardless there were some online forums like Skate Perception where you could ask technical questions and get feedback on your work from fellow skate media types. <br><br>
                <b>What questions did you ask?</b><br>
                In the beginning it was a lot of asking technical things like which camera is the best and why, how to slow mo footage, which settings are best for filming, etc. Basic entry-level camera stuff.<br><br> 
                <b>What online resources did you use, if any?</b><br>
                Like I previously said, in my early days of filming I used the skate media forum Skate Perception to get my answers. My questions were always pretty generic, so it’s not like I even had to be an active member; I just had to scour the archives looking for someone else that asked the same thing. Kids would make step-by-step how-to guides on how to do things like modify a fisheye or pirate editing software.<br><br>
                <b>How did personal and online resources differ?</b><br>
                Personal and online resources differed in that personal resources, like asking a more experienced acquaintance, was obviously more direct--my question would be addressed exactly how I posed it, in real time. I feel like personal resources were also more practical, too. What I mean by that is like online resources, to contrast, tend to be more idealistic or overly technical, telling you things like “well this camera has more megapixels so it’s better”, whereas a person in real life would be like “yeah, but that doesn’t really matter”. I don’t know how to articulate it that well, but there’s definitely a vibe to online resources sometimes, especially media related ones, where it feels like people are jockeying to be the best or smartest of the group. You also can’t really evaluate how credible people are online. For all I know, a guy telling me that a new camera is absolutely necessary could have no idea what he’s talking about. He could be one of those guys that use a camera more as a status symbol than a tool, you know? But on the other hand, with online resources you get a melting pot of opinions and experience levels, so it beats a one-on-one personal resource in that way, just statistically speaking; you’re able to get a spread of what people think. What makes it difficult is navigating that spread, trying to synthesize everything in spite of people’s inherent biases.<br><br>
                <b>What did you hope to gain when you first began sharing, publishing, or broadcasting your work?</b><br>
                I wanted to be a part of the skate community, to follow in the footsteps of the skaters and videomakers that I looked up to so much. My dream was to be a productive and respected part of that world, to make videos that people liked to watch. There was obviously some ego stuff going on, too, like I wanted people to think my friends and I are good at skating and think we’re cool to watch--there’s always that slight narcissism to skating (“watch me!”).<br><br>
                <b>What do you take away from the sharing process now?</b><br>
                For a while the sharing process was kind of a double-edged sword; if I saw someone else’s work that I thought was good, I wouldn’t like it because I would be jealous it wasn’t me, and if I saw someone else’s work that was bad, I wouldn’t like it because I knew I could do better. Obviously that’s a pretty immature attitude, and I think I’ve grown out of that for the most part. Now, I personally like sharing, whether it’s asking/answering questions or reviewing each other people’s work, because it gives you feedback on how people will respond to a particular work, which is obvious, but oftentimes in media, especially editing, it gets so easy to go down a rabbit hole of your own narrative that might be completely lost on someone else that’s watching with a completely different mindset. It’s like a focus group in that way. You get to see what people like, what people understand something as, etc. I think that with sharing, as with most things in life, finding a happy medium is key; you don’t want to take everyone’s opinion to heart and thus not trust your own intuitions or vision, but at the same time, you don’t want to sit on a high horse and think you’ve got it all figured out. You want to execute your vision, but not at the expense of isolating yourself from your collaborators and/or audience.<br><br>
                <b>How do you gain more knowledge about this field? (Editing? Shooting? Distribution?)</b><br>
                I gain more knowledge about this field in a few different ways. One, by sheer trial and error--trying something and seeing if it works or not. A lot of what I’ve learned is basically me trying to mimic something I saw that I like and trying to reverse engineer to figure out how to execute my own take on it. Like even going frame by frame on a skate video to see how a certain animation or compositing was done. I learn a lot of technical things on the internet, mostly on YouTube. There are seemingly infinite amounts of tutorials now on how to do pretty much everything. It’s honestly pretty crazy how useful and now indispensable YouTube is for so many areas of my life. I’m also lucky enough to have a few mentors that have taught me so much over the years. Mike Gilbert, the guy in charge of the video department at Thrasher, has kind of taken me under his wing since his days at Blackbox (Zero, Fallen, Mystery, etc.), not only giving me opportunities throughout the years to go on trips and get a salary position filming skateboarding, but also for being a constant role model I can look up to and get legitimate feedback from. His work is, and has been, so solid, so I definitely regard his opinions very highly. He knows what he’s talking about; he’s been there himself. That’s probably the most important aspect of a boss: respect--knowing that they know what they’re talking about. Believing in the hierarchy--they’re the boss for a reason. The same goes for Ryan Allan, but more for photography and navigating the business side of skateboarding. I’m lucky to call him a friend so he can show me the ropes from time to time.<br><br>
                <b>How do you improve your trade? (Editing? Shooting? Distribution?)</b><br>
                I improve my trade by making videos as much as I can. I feel like the “work” side of my job, having to film a certain thing even if I’m not in the mood, even like a contest, has helped me in my trade so much. Not only is it practice and keeping my skills sharp for the technical side of things like camera work, it’s more generally setting a goal and then accomplishing it. Which sounds like such a job-interview cliche, but a big part of my position in the skateboard industry is getting the job done. The industry is so fast paced now with web videos that that’s such a big deal, to get things done professionally as quickly as possible. I also improve my trade by just being present in skate culture and culture at large, too--just seeing everything that comes out helps hone my taste by seeing exactly what I like and what I don’t like. It gives me ideas of things to try or things to avoid. It’s basically just being open emotionally to react to different things.<br><br>
                <b>What skills do you feel like you have mastered?</b><br>
                It’s so hard to say. Skateboarding and skateboard media is so subjective that one person’s idea of “perfect” is another person’s “garbage”. There’s not really a consistent rubric in that way. With that said, I feel like I’m constantly growing because I’m always a little disappointed in myself after I’m done with a project. Sure, I always try my best and I’m proud of what I put out, but I am always able to see areas where I can improve, which is kind of depressing, but also inspiring to keep going. I feel like if I thought that I had mastered something, things would get boring--I would have nowhere to go from there. As far as things I have gotten better at, I think I’ve learned how to take criticism maturely--to not take things personally. That’s probably the most practical and useful skill I have improved upon. Because working with other people well is so crucial in my job, whether it’s Thrasher media directors, brand managers, etc. Respecting their opinions and realizing they’re intention is to make a good product (i.e., not hurting my feelings just for the hell of it) makes collaborating more successful and the final product that much better as a result.<br><br>
                <b>What skills have you gained through producing skateboard media that you apply to other parts of your life?</b><br>
                The do-it-yourself mentality. There isn’t a school program for skateboard media, so you pretty much have to teach yourself. Sure, there are resources--more than ever, nowadays--but still, there isn’t a well paved path to success like with other lines of work. You have to forge your own path, taking shots in the dark, so to speak, to figure things out. So that applies to other parts of my life in that if there is something I’m not sure about I’m fairly apt to just try and see what happens. I’m not that intimidated by failure. If something goes wrong, I don’t give up and shut down; I just look for other ways to try. Another key skill that applies elsewhere is teamwork. With producing skate media, I’m dealing with so many different players: skaters, team managers, brand managers, record companies, other filmers, etc. Constantly dealing and collaborating with different people teaches me how to navigate the world with a little more grace than I was born with. Also, being responsible with my time. My position allows me to make my own schedule for the most part, so doing that responsibly (i.e., getting the job done on time) is crucial to my success. That intrinsically applies to other parts of my life because my time is a zero-sum game; since I’m the one in control of my work schedule, I have to constantly evaluate my personal life in terms of opportunity cost. It’s more stressful than people might initially think, but it’s also really rewarding when I find the right balance of getting my work done and satisfying my personal life.<br><br>
                <b>What jobs do you think demand a similar skill set? Explain your reasoning?</b><br>
                Any job that requires a person to be creative, but also cognizant of mainstream taste to produce a palatable product to the masses. To differentiate yourself, but in an agreeable way. Any job that requires the knowledge of the in-depth history and current events of the particular industry; skateboarding has so many subtleties and nuances that make it near impossible to successfully navigate without being aware of. Any job that doesn’t follow the 9-5 workday standard, where the worker is for the most part independent. Any job that demands cooperation with pretty much all the levels of the supply chain. On a technical level, any job that requires heavy and adept usage of new technology (i.e., new cameras and camera accessories) and computer programs. You have to be able to change with the times to stay relevant. For these reasons, a small business owner seems to demand a similar set of skills. A small business owner probably loves the industry in which he/she is working, but also needs to make money to stay afloat. They have ideals about how things ought to be and use that as inspiration for their product. In a similar way, a skateboard media producers obviously loves skateboarding and has notions of taste, but since he needs to make a living, he needs to temper his vision to the preferences of the audience, at least until he’s well-respected enough to confidently execute his vision without any concessions. It’s hard to find a perfect parallel to the skateboard media job, especially since it’s that strange middle-ground blend of documentation and art. Perhaps a documentary filmmaker is pretty similar. They’re passionate about what they do, and their goal is to effect change (whether it’s starting a conversation or calling people to action) while presenting their message in an artistic way. Skateboarding is quite similar; as a skate filmer, I want to make people feel a certain way--get them inspired to go explore, skate, and be on the whole creative--but I want to present that in my own artistic way. And with both occupations, both are on the ground, exploring, synthesizing lots of information and emotion into an eventual audiovisual product.<br><br> 
                <b>Can you describe your motivation to produce skate media now?</b><br>
                My motivation to produce skate media now is mainly a product of my love and nostalgia for the skate videos of the past and the effect they had on me. As someone lucky enough to have a job at Thrasher, I feel somewhat responsible for portraying skateboarding to the masses correctly. When I was a young and impressionable kid, I looked to videos, magazines, and websites, as a guide to what is cool and important in skateboarding. Obviously the skateboard industry has changed so much since my formative years--most notably it has accelerated exponentially both in terms of progression and media output--but regardless, I still want to try to inspire kids like how I was inspired. I want to showcase things in skateboarding that I find important and cool as somewhat of a guide to younger kids to react to--either they’ll like it or they won’t, but either way, they will start to develop their own taste. I don’t want to just do my job blindly to make money at the expense of not being true to skateboarding. That would be reckless to the kids who look at media at impressionable ages.<br><br>
                <b>If you there is anything else you would like to share about your participation in this culture, please feel free to share.</b><br>
                The skateboarding world is such a strange subculture that most people don’t understand. It’s a sport, yet it’s an artform. It’s a business, yet people do it for fun. We’re all in competition with one another, yet we’re a “big family”. A lot of times you can’t really apply logic to skateboarding. Some people are deemed “kooks” and are ousted from the industry for vague and petty things, while some people are championed for no apparent reason outside of groupthink. Sometimes the anti-jocks that are skateboarders turn out to be worse than the jocks they reacted against. All these things make skateboarding an enigma. It’s why I love it, but also hate it sometimes. Despite these dichotomies, the pure act of riding a skateboard though will always redeem itself from its tangled culture.<br><br>
                <b>Were there any adults or mentors that supported your learning within skateboard media production in any way? Can you elaborate?</b><br>
                See above where I talk about Mike Gilbert and Ryan Allan. Let me know if you need me to elaborate on anything there.<br><br>
                <b>Have you offered support to or mentored any younger skate media producers in any way? Can you elaborate?</b><br>
                Definitely. Especially lately with the advent of Instagram, I’ll get lots of questions either directly on my posts or via direct messages. It’s funny because pretty much all of them just ask me what camera they should get or what fisheye I use--gear-related questions. I totally get it--I was that same kid ten years ago--but now I see how gear is so arbitrary. It seems like kids think that all they have to do is get a “good” camera, and then they’re set, which is totally not the case, at least for me. So at every chance I get I’ll stress to them (after I give them the advice they’re looking for about what camera I use or what I recommend, etc.) that it doesn’t really matter. It’s cliche at this point to talk about, but it’s really true that it’s about what you do with the camera, and even more so in post-production, what you do with the footage. That’s where all the magic happens. Especially nowadays where entry-level cameras are pretty much amazing in terms of the footage they produce, I tell kids to focus a lot on editing and try to develop a cohesive idiosyncratic vibe to their projects; cameras don’t have that mode (yet).<br><br>
