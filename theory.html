                <span class="text-muted">Why the skateboard connection?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Throughout the duration of my ethnography, I kept having this uneasy feeling that I was placing too much emphasis on this culture and my experience growing up. I truly believe that skateboarding and creating media for skateboarding facilitated a lot of my own cognitive growth, but would anyone else find this as important as myself? Is observing young people make skateboarding media worth spending so much time and energy on? Why skateboarding? Why does skateboarding still force it’s way into almost every facet of my life 20 years after I picked it up? 
            <br><br>
            I think the answer to this has so much to do with how I’ve always made it through any learning experience. The public schools I attended growing up were always very highly ranked, yet I never felt like they were for me. Rigid schedules, confined spaces, irrelevant information, and uninspiring assignments made school and learning something I resented. 
            <br><br>
             I see now that where school came up short, the skateboarding culture I belonged to filled in. I took every opportunity to read about, write about, and create projects that centered around the skateboarding community of which I belonged. Skateboarding was, and in many ways still is, the easiest way to connect learning to what I enjoy.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">But to speak ill
                <span class="text-muted">of educational systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">in the United States would be too easy a way out, and, in many cases, misguided. Schools definitely benefit people in monumental ways, myself included. But our population of learners is one that is large, diverse, and extremely complex. To develop a system that can cater to all students’ needs all the while fitting into this idea of standardization is proving to be impossible (Smyth, 2016). Add in the fact that students are now expected to be ready for an innovative society that evolves so rapidly that the obsoletion of jobs is commonplace, and it almost seems like a cruel joke (Salon Article).
            <br><br>
            The myth that a child must do well in elementary school, succeed in difficult classes in high school, and get into a great college to excel in the 21st century is a dangerous one (Salon Article). Almost as dangerous as the myth that hard work is the best solution for our most disadvantaged youth looking to achieve upward social mobility (Greenstone et al, 2013). 
            <br><br>
            All the time we see a school that is doing more harm than good to our most vulnerable population of young learners (Post Article). And you don’t have to look far to see the troubles facing those destined for success at the other side of the spectrum either (Times Article). Although one could easily classify these situations as outliers, there appears to be a disconnect between what society wants and what all our schools can give.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Fortunately for me,

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">and the production of skateboard videos to bridge that disconnect*. And fortunately for everyone else, there has been a strong reimagining of education taking place for sometime now. A lot of people are trying to redefine what a school is, what education is, when and where they can occur, and who is teaching who (smyth).<br><br>There has been nationwide push to implement the new 21st century learning standards in schools, which would call for classes that give students the opportunity to learn by producing projects, ideally through innovative media and technology. This is inline with the national desire to prepare students to think critically and creatively in a complex real world context (P21.og). But using new technologies to harbor higher level thinking among youth in schools is not a new and shiny endeavor. For decades, we have experimented with computers and other new technologies as a means to free students from the mundane discourse of “teacher initiates, students respond, teacher evaluates” (Scardamalia, 1996, p.258).<br><br>Scientist and educator, Seymour Papert was on the forefront of this movement with his constructionist theory and LOGO, a simple programming language used by children to learn math and geometry. LOGO afforded children the ability to manipulate the movements of a virtual turtle by providing computational commands (Goldman 2012). Constructionism, which aligns closely with Piaget’s constructivism, “views learning as building relationships between old and new knowledge, in interactions with others, while creating artifacts of social relevance” (Kafai, 2006, p. 35). These two theories more or less lay the groundwork for why digital media and technology are seen as powerful tools within the classroom. <br><br> So why, with all the great advances in technology and learning theories within the past few decades, are we still not reaching everyone? Why are still attempting a ‘one size fits all’ approach in schools where magic bullet technological solutions always fail (smyth)?</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Mizuko Ito,
                <span class="text-muted">a cultural anthropologist of technology use,</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">along with numerous researchers at the Digital Media and Learning Research Hub, ironically located at the Southern California skateboarding mecca University of California, Irvine, have suggested that the solution is to “meet kids where they are, and push them to go further.” (Ito, 2016). This model that Ito and the DML Hub have developed is called Connected Learning, and is defined as, “learning that is socially connected, interest-driven, and oriented towards educational opportunity.” “Connected learning takes root when young people find peers who share interests, when academic institutions recognize and make interest-driven learning relevant to school, and when community institutions provide resources and safe spaces for more peer-driven forms of learning. (Ito et al, 2013)”. <br><br>This approach is guided by three key findings: 1) the disconnect between classroom and everyday learning, 2) the meaningful nature of learning that is embedded in valued relationships, practice, and culture, and 3) the need for learning contexts that bring together in-school and out-of-school learning and activity. Basically, because schools cannot serve everyone in the same capacity, connected learning suggests as educators we should take notice of the innovative things students are already intrinsically motivated by and enjoy doing with their peers, and support them both in and out of school. And due to technology and media becoming prominent in the lives of many young people, with 92% of U.S. teens age 13-17 reporting going on daily and 24% reporting themselves as being online constantly, this seems to be where we should meet and push our young people to go further (Pew Study 2015). <br><br>By leveraging the power and ubiquitous nature of media and technology, and by examining what it is students and young people already engage in, connected learning seeks to lessen the burden of education on schools alone. Peer groups, mentors, parents, communities, media, or technology can all be combined in a fashion that promotes 21st century skills all the while encouraging individual students to pursue what it is that interests them.</p>

            <p class="lead">that skateboarding, just like video games, fan fiction, music production, graffiti art, or any other creative endeavor we see young people doing on their own, has the potential, when nurtured and viewed through the lens of Connected Learning, to be an extremely rich learning environment that can fill the gaps left by the standardization of education. The ethnographic research, content, and analysis I will present in the upcoming sections will hopefully serve as evidence to support my claim.</p>
